Once the download completes open the downloaded file.

This is the first window you should see. Our first step is to click the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox.

## Attention!

Failure to add Python to the PATH may result in strange errors that will require reinstallation of Python as the easiest fix.

You should also see `>>>` towards the bottom. This means you are now inside your python interpreter.

Now that we are inside our python interpreter we can run python commands. Let's try one.
Type: `print("Hello World")` inside your PowerShell and press enter:

Your PowerShell should output the message "Hello World"

To exit out of your Python interpreter just type `exit()` and press enter:
