# Slack

[Back to Syllabus](../README.md)

Slack is a communication tool we will be using in Programming 101 and 102, as well as the PDX Code Guild's boot camps.

By the first day of class, you will be added to a channel, or chatroom. The channel's name will include the start date for the course.

For example, if your **Programming 101** class starts on **Aug 31, 2020**, the channel name will be **101_20-08-31** (class_YY-MM-DD).

## Turning in Labs

### 1. Search for recipient

At the top of the Slack window, you'll find a search bar that says `Search PDX Code Guild Intro Classes`.

![search bar](/resources/slack/search_bar.png)

Click the search bar and begin typing the name of the recipient

![search recipient](/resources/slack/search_keegan.png)

Click the recipient's name to open a Direct Message with them.

### 2. Create a code snippet.

Code must be submitted as a Slack code snippet, otherwise the code's formatting may get lost in translation.

Click the icon shaped like a **lightning bolt** on the bottom left of the chat box.

![shortcuts icon](/resources/slack/shortcuts_icon.png)

Select **Create code or text snippet**. You may need to search for "snippet" in the dropup menu that appears after clicking the lightning bolt icon.

Enter your code in the box labeled **Content**. You can optionally give your file a name and specify the language as **Python** using the dropdown in the upper right.

Once you've pasted your code, click the green **Create Snippet** button and your file will be uploaded.

### 3. Copying code from Slack

The instructor will be posting all class code into Slack.

If you want to copy code from Slack into VS Code, it is advisable to copy the code in the following way:

Hover over the code and find the icon with the **three horizontal dots**.

![file options icon](/resources/slack/file_options_icon.png)

Click the icon and select **View Raw**

![view raw dropdown](/resources/slack/view_raw_dropdown.png)

This will open a plain text version of the code.

Note:

If you copy and paste directly from the Slack chat, you may encounter strange errors when the code is run.

This is due to invisible whitespace characters that are present in the rendered version of the code in Slack.

Copying the 'raw' version will avoid such errors.
