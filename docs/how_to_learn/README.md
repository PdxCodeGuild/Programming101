Welcome to the PDX Code Guild and thanks for joining us in our Strategic Learning course, which break down some of the key elements of what it means to learn.

We’ll take a look at the physiology behind learning, including how new memories are formed and the parts of the brain that are involved in encoding them as well as the important role that physical health plays in our ability to absorb and retain new information.

We’ll explore the different ways we process data and how sleep can help us to learn.

Finally, we’ll expose some of the common pitfalls we may encounter while learning as well as some techniques for overcoming them.

Learning outside the context of a traditional classroom can present its own unique challenges. With no one looking over our shoulder, grading our work and critiquing each step of the way, it’s easy to fall victim to lack of motivation, procrastination and self-doubt. These types of feelings can get us caught in a negative feedback loop, causing us to feel that we’ll never reach our goal and this can lead us to give up on learning.

This course is designed to provide techniques that will help to keep morale high and interest piqued, as well as to maximize information retention and recall. The concepts and strategies outlined in this course are meant to compliment all learning styles and to provide activities and tools to enhance their efficacy.

At PDX Code Guild, our mission is to cultivate our students' confidence in their ability to solve the unique programming puzzles they will encounter on their new career path in the technology industry. We are passionate in our quest for knowledge and we are excited to have you along for the journey.
