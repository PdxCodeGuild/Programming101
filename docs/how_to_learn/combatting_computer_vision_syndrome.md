The following may be practiced to help alleviate/prevent Computer Vision Syndrome:

- Resting your eyes at least 15 minutes after each 2 hours of computer use

- Looking away from the computer and into the distance for at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes (Pomodoro Technique / 20-20-20 Rule)

- Enlarging the text on your computer screen

- Reducing glare from nearby light sources

- Using a screen glare filter

- Using a flat-screen monitor

- Positioning your screen so that the center is 4 to 5 inches below your eye level

- Positioning your screen so that it is 20 to 28 inches from your eye

- Remembering to blink often

- Wearing lenses to correct your vision

- Using lubricating eye drops

- Using a humidifier

- Minimize caffeine intake

- Drinking plenty of water

- Drinking green tea during your break may help even more, because green tea contains antioxidants called catechins that may help your eyes produce tears for better lubrication.

- Taking a prescription medicine to increase tear production
