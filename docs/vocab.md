## Argument

- An object passed to a function to fill one of its parameters

- When a function is called, arguments are passed to fill the functions parameters

## Class

- A data structure which acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

- All Python datatypes are created with classes.

- When we create an object, we're creating an 'instance' of a pre-defined class which shares all the attributes of the class but can have properties unique to each instance

- Classes have attributes which can be functions or variables

## Code Block

- A section of code that executes together

- In Python, code blocks are defined using horizontal indentation.

- The first line of code in a code block determines its indentation and all subsequent lines in that block must match that indentation.

## Concatenation
- Adding two strings together with a plus sign (`+`) to form a single string

## Docstring

- A multi-line string at the beginning of a function's code block that provides documentation about the function, its parameters and its return value

## Function

- A named code block that performs a specific task.

- Functions reduce repetition in our code by allowing us to write code in a generic way and use it with multiple values.

- Functions are executed with parentheses after their name. (e.g. `print()`)

## Index

- An item's position in a sequence (list, string, etc.)

- Indices are always integers and must correspond to an existing item in the sequence, otherwise an `IndexError` will be raised.

## Loop

- A code block that repeats until a certain condition is met.

- With a `for` loop, the condition is that there are more items left in the `sequence`

- With a `while` loop, we define the condition directly.

## Method

- A function that only manipulates the object to which it belongs

## Module
## Mutable (Changeable)
## Object

- A collection of variables and methods that act on those variables. 

- A class is a blueprint for an object.

- The variables and methods contained in an object are called its 'attributes'

- An object's attributes are accessed with dot notation (e.g. `'abc'.upper()`) 

## Operand

- A piece of data being used to perform an operation

## Operation

- Any process that manipulates data (operands)

## Operator

- A symbol or word that performs an operation on one or more pieces of data (operands)

## Ordered Sequence

- A sequence whose items can be retrieved using their position in the sequence

- An item's position in a sequence is called its 'index'. 

- Lists (`list`) and Strings (`str`) are examples of ordered sequences. 

- Python Sets (`set`) are an example of an *un*-ordered sequence.

## Parameter
## Return Value
## Scope
## Sequence
## Subscriptable
## Typecasting
## Variable
- A named storage space for data. 

- Variables can store objects of any datatype and can be used in operations involving that datatype.

- Variables can be re-defined with new values at any time.
