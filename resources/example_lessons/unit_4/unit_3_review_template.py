# datatype: boolean (bool)
# True / False


# booleans are Capitalized in Python

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

### THIS SECTION CAN BE SKIPPED, IF NEEDED AS WELL AS ALL FURTHER REFERENCES TO TRUTHY/FALSEY

# all datatypes have typecasting functions
# str(), int(), float()

# bool(object) - return a boolean representation of the object

# Truthy/Falsey
# If an object has value, it will convert to True
# If an object has NO value, it will convert to False


# zero has no value
# 1 (or any number other than zero) has value 

# blank string has no value
# string with at least one character has value

# blank list has no value
# list with at least one item has value

# print(bool(x), bool(y))
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Comparison Operators - compare two pieces of data and result in a boolean
# all comparisons need two sides


# == equality
# != inequality

# < 'strictly' less than
# <= less than or equal to

# > 'strictly' greater than
# >= greater than or equal to

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# other datatypes can be compared

### THIS SECTION CAN BE SKIPPED, IF NEEDED ###
# avoid < and > with datatypes other than numbers (at least for now)

# checking for alphabetical order
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Logical Operators - combine two comparisons and result in a single boolean
# and, or, not

# all logical statements needs two comparisons


# and - True only if BOTH comparisons are True

# or - True if at least ONE comparison is True

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# not - flip a boolean

# 'not' works in front of any code that produces a boolean
# .isnumeric() - string method which returns a boolean indicating if the string is all numbers or not

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# Conditional Statements - run different 'code blocks' based on the outcome of comparisons
# keywords: if, elif, else

# code block - A section of code that executes together.
#              In Python, code blocks are defined using horizontal indentation

'''
Conditional Statements
----------------------
- must start with an if
- every single if will be checked
- elif will only be checked if the preceding if and other elifs were False
- else will run if all other conditions were False
- if/elif will only be checked until a True condition is found
'''

'''
Conditional statements will always have:
- 1 if 
- 0 to infinity elifs
- 0 or 1 else
'''
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# 'nested conditionals' - conditionals within the code block of other conditionals

'''
# avoid repeating x < 10 using a nested conditional
if x < 10 and x < 5:
    # ... do something
elif x < 10 and x == 5:
    # ... # do something
elif x < 10 and x > 5:
    # ... # do something
