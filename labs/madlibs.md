Write a simple program that prompts the user for seven inputs then
prints a [Mad Lib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) as the result.

It can be a little tricky to find a plain-text Mad Lib that's easy to copy and paste. Instead, choose some song lyrics, a poem or quote, or create your own story.

## Instructions

1. Choose some text to act as your Mad Lib
2. Ask the user for each word you'll put in your Mad Lib
3. Use an **f-string** to put each word into the Mad Lib

## Example:

```
Give me an antonym for 'data': nonmaterial
Tell me an adjective: Bearded
Give me a sciency buzzword: half-stack
A type of animal (plural): parrots
Some Sciency thing: warp drive
Another sciency thing: Trilithium crystals
Sciency adjective: biochemical

Nonmaterial Scientist Job Description:

Seeking a bearded engineer, able to work on half-stack projects with a team of parrots.

Key responsibilities:
    - Extract patterns from non-material
    - Optimize warp drive
    - Transform trilithium crystals into biochemical material.
```


## Extra Challenge 1
* Make a solution that asks for a number or numbers, and does a mathematical operation printing out the result of the math

## Extra Challenge 2
* Make it a repeatable game using a `while` loop
