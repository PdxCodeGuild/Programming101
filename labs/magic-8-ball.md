## Instructions
Let's write a program to simulate the classic "[Magic Eight Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)"

1. Print a welcome screen to the user.

```
Welcome to the amazing Magic 8 Ball!
```

2. Prompt the user to ask the 8-ball a question.

```
What is your question?
```

3. Use the random module's `random.choice()` to choose a prediction.  
```
Searching my magic globe...
```
4. Display the result of the prediction.
```
Sorry, it is highly unlikely :(
```

## Advanced version 1

- Let the user choose if they want to ask a second question.

## Advanced version 2

- Ask the user if they want to ask another question, using a while loop.
