# Rock Paper Scissors

Let's play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.

1. The computer will ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, scissors)
2. The computer will randomly choose rock, paper or scissors
3. Determine who won and tell the user

Let's list all the cases:
- rock vs rock (tie)
- rock vs paper
- rock vs scissors
- paper vs rock
- paper vs paper
- paper vs scissors
- scissors vs rock
- scissors vs paper
- scissors vs scissors

## Advanced Version 1

Catch all tie conditions using a single if conditional.

## Advanced Version 2

Ask the user if they want to play again, using a while loop.

## Advanced Version 3

Use a dictionary where each key is one of the choices, and the value associated with the key is a list containing the two other choices.

[//]: # (instructor note: write the tie case, the first case, have them write the others using elif)
