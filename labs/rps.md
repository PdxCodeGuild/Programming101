# Rock Paper Scissors

Let's play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.

   
1. The computer will ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, scissors). Use a `for` loop to display the possible choices.
2. The computer will randomly choose rock, paper or scissors.
3. Compare the players' choices and determine who won and tell the user.

## Extra Challenge 1

Catch all tie conditions using a single if conditional.

## Extra Challenge 2

Ask the user if they want to play again, using a while loop.

## Extra Challenge 3

Use a dictionary where each key is one of the choices, and the value associated with the key is a list containing the two other choices.

[//]: # (instructor note: write the tie case, the first case, have them write the others using elif)
