### print()

Run the following code in your terminal:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```

**Windows**

### Concatenating
1. On a new line, concatenate two strings:

```python
print("Hello" + "Mercury!")
```

Switch to your terminal and run the following command:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```
#### Result

Do you notice that there is no space in between `Hello` and `Mercury`?

Edit your code to include a white space:
```python
print("Hello " + "Mercury!")
```
