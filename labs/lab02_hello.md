# Lab 2: Hello!

## Directions


### print()

1. Create a new file `hello.py` in VS Code.
2. Say hello! with the following code:


```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Run the following code in your terminal:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```

**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```
#### Result

```bash
Hello World!
```

### Concatenating

1. On a new line, concatenate two strings:

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello" + "Mercury!")
```

Switch to your terminal and run the following command:

**Mac**
```bash
python3 hello.py
```
**Windows**
```bash
py hello.py
```

#### Result

```bash
Hello World!
HelloMercury!
```

Do you notice that there is no space in between `Hello` and `Mercury`?

Edit your code to include a white space:
```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello " + "Mercury!")
```

#### Result

```bash
Hello World!
Hello Mercury!
```

### comments
Now let's go back and add comments to explain the code.

```python
# saying hello to the world
print("Hello World!")
# saying hellow to Mercury
print("Hello " + "Mercury!")
```
