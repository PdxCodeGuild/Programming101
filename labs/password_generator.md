# Password Generator

Let's generate a ten-character password using a `while` loop and `random.choice()`.

The final result will be a string of random characters all on one line.

Example output:
```
Your password: Q45pA%x9PJ
```

## Extra Challenge 1

Allow the user to choose how many characters the password will be.

## Extra Challenge 2

Allow the user to choose how many letters, numbers, and punctuation characters they want in their password. Mix everything up using `list()`, `random.shuffle()`, and `''.join()`.
