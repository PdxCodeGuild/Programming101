# **Unit 3 Practice**

## **Exercise 4**

### **4.1**

- Assign a `number` to a variable.

- Determine whether the number is within 10 of 100.

      number: 92
      output: 92 is within 10 of 100.

      number: 51
      output: 51 is not within 10 of 100.

### **4.2**

- Have the user enter values for `number_1` and `number_2`.

- Have the user choose the `limit` of how many numbers may be in between the two.

- Determine whether `number_1` and `number_2` are within the limit set by the user.

      number 1: 800
      number 2: 1200
      limit: 500

      output:
      800 is within 500 of 1200

      ---------
      number 1: 1575
      number 2: 1200
      limit: 500

      output:
      1575 is within 500 of 1200
      
      --------
      number 1: 1000
      number 2: 15
      limit: 3

      output:
      15 is not within 3 of 1000
