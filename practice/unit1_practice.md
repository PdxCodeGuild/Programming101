Unit 1 Practice
===============

Exercise 1
---------
### **1.1**

- Create a signature header

      *'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*
          Project: Python
           Version: 1.0
      Author: Guido van Rossum
       Email: bdfl@python.com
           Date: Jan, 1994
      *'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*

- add it to your code once as *single*-line comments, and once as a *multi*-line comment



### **1.2**  

`print` the signature header under its
respective comment using the same format as the comment - 
single lines under the single line comments, multi-line under 
the multi-line comment

**Exercise 2**
---------
**"Comment out"** lines of code until you acheive 
the following output:


    The time has come,' the Walrus said,
    To talk of many things:
    Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax —
    Of cabbages and kings —
    And why the sea is boiling hot —
    And whether pigs have wings!'


Also, add `comments` on the lines of code you keep
that denote the number of the line in the poem. These can be
added on the same line as the code.

**The code**:
```python
print("The time has come,' the Walrus said,")
print("’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves")
print("To talk of many things:")
print("Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:")
print("Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —")
print("All mimsy were the borogoves, ")
print("Of cabbages — and kings —")
print("And the mome raths outgrabe. ")
print("And why the sea is boiling hot —")
print("O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!")
print("And whether pigs have wings.'")
```

**Exercise 3**
----------
### **3.1**
- Concatenate together the letters of a word
- Print the word

### **3.2**
- Concatenate together the words and spaces
of a sentence.
- Print the sentence.

### **3.3**
- Concatenate together each individual character in a sentence,
including spaces and punctuation. 
- Print the full sentence.

**Exercise 4**
----------

Using one or more string methods:

### **4.1** 
Capitalize a word

    word: bicycle 
    output: Bicycle
      
    word: guitar
    output: Guitar
    
    word: enveleope
    output: Envelope


### **4.2**
Display a word in all capital letters and all lowercase letters
       
    word: vIoLiN
    output: VIOLIN violin


### **4.3**
Exchange all instances of a letter within a word with a different
  
    word: Mississippi

    ...exchange 's' for 'z'...

    output: Mizzizzippi

**Exercise 5**
--------------
Print a famous quote with the following criteria

- Use only one `print()`
  
- Using escape characters:
  - Place the quote and its author's name on separate lines 
  - Indent the author's name
  - Break the quote up onto multiple lines, if appropriate.
  
- Include quotation marks around the quote
  

      Output:
      "The secret of genius is to carry the 
      spirit of the child into old age, which 
      means never losing your enthusiasm."
