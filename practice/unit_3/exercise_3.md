# Unit 3 Practice

## **Exercise 3**

You've got a very important message to get out to all your followers on Twitter. Unfortunately, Twitter only allows **280** characters per Tweet. Your message is **over 1,000** characters long and you're wondering **how many** Tweets it will take to get your whole message out.

### **3.1**

Calculate the number of Tweets required, **rounding up** to the nearest integer.

### **3.2**

Ask the user for the `number of characters` in their message

- `if` the length of the message is **less than** the `max_length` allowed for a Tweet, output a `message` telling the user they only need one Tweet

- Otherwise, calculate the number of Tweets required, **rounding up** to the nearest integer and output a `message` telling the user the number of Tweets they will need.

### **3.3**

Display different messages to the user depending on how many Tweets their message requires.
