# Unit 3 Practice

## **Exercise 1 - Geometry**

Let's do a little geometry!

### **1.1**

- Create three variables `a`, `b` and `c`.

- Assign a number to each to represent the lengths of the sides of a **triangle**.

- Calculate the `perimeter` of the triangle

  **Output**

      A triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5 has a perimeter of 12.
---

### **1.2**

- Create variables with numbers representing the `base` and `height` measurements of the **triangle**. Select `a`, `b` or `c` to represent the `base`.

- Calculate the `area` of the triangle.

  **Output**

      A triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 8 has an area of 20.0.      
      ---

      A triangle with a base of 2.8 and a height of 2.02 has an area of 3.08.
---

### **1.3**

- Assign a number to a variable to represent the `radius` of a circle.
- Use the constant for `pi` contained within the `math` module and the `radius` *variable* to calculate the `circumference` and `area` of a ***circle***.

  **Output**
                
        Circle

        Radius: 5
        Circumference: 31.4159...
        Area: 78.5398...
---

### **1.4**

- Calculate the `volume` of a ***sphere*** with the same `radius`.

  **Output**

      Sphere
      
      Radius: 5
      Volume: 523.5987...
---

### **1.5**

- Assign a number to a variable to represent the `radius` of a **second** circle.
- Use the two radii to calculate the area of an  [annulus](https://www.google.com/search?q=annulus%20area).

  **Output**
      
      Annulus

      Outer Radius: 5
      Inner Radius: 3
      Area: 50.26548245743669
---


### **Extra challenges**

### **1.6**

- Create two variables, `a` and `b` to represent the adjacent sides of a right triangle.

- Find the **hypotenuse** of a triangle using `a` and `b`. Assign the value to a variable `c`.

- Display the result to the user

      A triangle with sides of 65 and 72 has a hypotenuse of 97.
---

### **1.7**

Use the `random` module to generate **random integer** values for the circle and sphere's `radius` and the triangle's `base` and `height`.

---

### **1.8**

Have the user enter all number values used in previous versions. Don't forget that `input()` always returns a `string`.
