## **Exercise 4 - Number Proximity**

### **4.1**

- Assign a `number` to a variable.

- Determine whether the number is within 10 of 100.

**Output**

    number: 92
    output: 92 is within 10 of 100.

    number: 108
    output: 108 is within 10 of 100.

    number: 51
    output: 51 is not within 10 of 100.

### **4.2**

- Have the user enter values for `number_1` and `number_2`.

- Determine whether `number_1` is within 10 of `number_2`.

**Output**

    Enter the first number: 36
    Enter the second number: 28
    output: 36 is within 10 of 28.

    Enter the first number: 95
    Enter the second number: 15
    output: 95 is not within 10 of 15.

### **4.3**

- Have the user enter values for `number_1` and `number_2`.

- Have the user choose the `limit` of how many numbers may be in between the two.

- Determine whether `number_1` and `number_2` are within the limit set by the user.

      Enter the first number: 235
      Enter the second number: 555
      Enter how far apart the numbers are allowed to be: 1000

      235 is within 1000 of 555.

      Enter the first number: 66
      Enter the second number: 62
      Enter how far apart the numbers are allowed to be: 5

      66 is within 5 of 62.
      ---

      Enter the first number: 34
      Enter the second number: 101
      Enter how far apart the numbers are allowed to be: 20
