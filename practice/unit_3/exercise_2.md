# Unit 3 Practice

## Exercise 2 - String Comparisons

### **2.1**

- Assign a letter to a variable to serve as the secret `answer`
  
- Ask the user to enter a `letter`, assign it to a variable
  
- `if` the user's `letter` is the same as the `answer`, inform the user they've guessed correctly. Otherwise, inform them they've erred and display the correct answer.

### **2.2**

- Ask the user for a `word`
- Ask the user for a `letter`
- Assign the `word` and the `letter` to variables
- Use the keyword `in` to determine if the `letter` is `in` the `word`
- Tell the user `if` the `letter` is `in` the `word`. Display the letter in uppercase
  
      Enter a word: umbrella
      Enter a letter: b

      output:
      The word "umbrella" contains the letter "B".

      -------------------
      Enter a word: umbrella
      Enter a letter: z

      output:
      The word "umbrella" does not contain the letter "Z".

### **2.3**

  If the word contains the letter, tell the user how many times the letter is in the word

      Enter a word: giraffe
      Enter a letter: f

      output:
      The word "giraffe" contains the letter "F" 2 times.

### **2.4**

  Using string methods, determine if the string the user entered contains only letters, no spaces, numbers or special characters.

  `if` the string contains characters **other than letters**, inform the user that those characters aren't allowed.
