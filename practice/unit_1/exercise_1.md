# Unit 1 Practice

## **Exercise 1**

### **1.1**

- Create a code signature to place in a comment at the top of your project to tell other developers who wrote the code.
  
- The signature should contain:
  - Project name
  - Version number
  - Author
  - Email
  - Date

- Add it to your code once as *single*-line comments, and once as a *multi*-line comment

      *'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*'--'*
          Project: Python
           Version: 1.0
      Author: Guido van Rossum
       Email: bdfl@python.com
           Date: Jan, 1994
      *'-.-'*'-.-'*'-.-'*'--'*

### **1.2**  

`print` the signature under its
respective comment using the same format as the comment -
single lines under the single line comments, multi-line under the multi-line comment
