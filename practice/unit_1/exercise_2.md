## **Exercise 2**

**"Comment out"** lines of code until you achieve
the following output:

    'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
    To talk of many things:
    Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax —
    Of cabbages and kings —
    And why the sea is boiling hot —
    And whether pigs have wings!'

Also, add `comments` on the lines of code you keep
that denote the number of the line in the poem. These can be
added on the same line as the code.

**The code**:

```python
print("'The time has come,' the Walrus said,")
print("'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves")
print("'To talk of many things:")
print("Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:")
print("Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —")
print("All mimsy were the borogoves, ")
print("Of cabbages — and kings —")
print("And the mome raths outgrabe. ")
print("And why the sea is boiling hot —")
print("O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!")
print("And whether pigs have wings!'")
```
