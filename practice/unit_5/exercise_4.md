# Unit 5 Practice

## **Exercise 4 - Fibonacci / Tribonacci**

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where **each consecutive number is the sum of the previous two**.

### **1.1**

Write a loop that adds the first 10 values of the Fibonacci sequence to a list.

Display the list.

Hint: You can create your list using the first two numbers in the sequence `[0,1]`

**Output**

    First ten Fibonacci numbers:
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

### **1.2**

Tri-bonacci! This is as it sounds. Create a new list of Tri-bonacci values where each consecutive number is the sum of the previous **three** numbers

Hint: You can create your list using the first three numbers in the sequence `[0,1,1]`

**Output**

    First ten Tribonacci numbers:
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81]

### **1.3**

Write both the Fibonacci and Tribonacci sequence loops **without** providing the first two or three starting values.

### **1.4**

Allow the user to enter the number of elements to calculate in both the Fibonacci and Tribonacci loops.
