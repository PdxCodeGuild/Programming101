# Unit 1 Practice

## **Exercise 1**

### **1.1**

- Using your choice of ***terminal***, create a directory for your PDX Code Guild projects. Name it something like `pdx_code`. **Avoid spaces in directory and file names**, you'll save yourself headaches later. 

- Inside your folder, create a **subdirectory** (folder within a folder) for `programming_101` and a subdirectory called `extra`

- Inside the `programming_101` directory, create subdirectories for each of the five units for the course: `unit_1`, `unit_2`, `unit_3`, `unit_4` and `unit_5`.

- Navigate back up to the `pdx_code` folder and create a `programming_102` directory. Create a subdirectory for each unit in Programming 102: `unit_1`, `unit_2`, `unit_3`, `unit_4` and `unit_5`

The final structure of your `pdx_code` folder should be:

- `pdx_code`
  - `extra`
  - `programming_101`
    - `unit_1`
    - `unit_2`
    - `unit_3`
    - `unit_4`
    - `unit_5`
  - `programming_102`
    - `unit_1`
    - `unit_2`
    - `unit_3`
    - `unit_4`
    - `unit_5`

- We actually don't need our `extra` folder. Navigate to the `pdx_code` folder using the terminal and delete it using terminal commands.
