## **Exercise 2**

**"Comment out"** lines of code until you achieve
the following output:

    The time has come,' the Walrus said,
    To talk of many things:
    Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax —
    Of cabbages and kings —
    And why the sea is boiling hot —
    And whether pigs have wings!'

Also, add `comments` on the lines of code you keep
that denote the number of the line in the poem. These can be
added on the same line as the code.

**The code**:

    print("The time has come,' the Walrus said,")
    print("’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves")
    print("To talk of many things:")
    print("Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:")
    print("Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —")
    print("All mimsy were the borogoves, ")
    print("Of cabbages — and kings —")
    print("And the mome raths outgrabe. ")
    print("And why the sea is boiling hot —")
    print("O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!")
    print("And whether pigs have wings.'")
