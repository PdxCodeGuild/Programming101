# Unit 2 Practice

## **Excercise 2**

### **2.1**

Use string methods to determine the number of times
a `letter` occurs in a `word`

    word: bookkeeper
    letter: k
    
    output: 2

### **2.2**
  
- Ask the user for a `word`
- Ask the user for a `letter`
- Assign the `word` and the `letter` to *variables*
- Determine how many times the `letter` occurs in the `word`

      Enter a word: hippopotamus
      Enter a letter to count: p

      Output:
      The letter 'p' occurs 3 times in 'hippopotamus'
