# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 5 - More Number Lists**

Use a loop and `random.randint()` to generate a list of ten `random_numbers` between 1 and 100.

### **5.1**

Count the number of even numbers in the list. **Hint**: You can use `% 2` to determine if a number is even or odd.

**Output**

    Numbers: [64, 3, 55, 94, 40, 56, 40, 69, 54, 3]
    There are 6 evens: [64, 94, 40, 56, 40, 54]

### **5.2**

Reverse the list using a loop and without any methods or built-in functions

**Output**

    numbers: 5, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    [25, 8100, 1849, 2704, 441, 2401, 8464, 1600, 1089, 7056]

### **5.3**

Sort the list of numbers in ascending order without using methods or built-in functions.

**Output**

    numbers: [62, 23, 56, 30, 55, 60, 31, 91, 93, 45]
    sorted:  [23, 30, 31, 45, 55, 56, 60, 62, 91, 93]

### **Hint:**

One way to accomplish this is by implementing a **bubble sort** algorithm.
