# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 5 - More Number Lists**

### **1.1**

Use a loop and `random.randint()` to generate a list of `random_numbers` between 1 and 100.

### **1.2**

Count the number of even numbers in the list. **Hint**: You can use `% 2` to determine if a number is even or odd.

    numbers: 5, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    output:
    There are 5 even numbers: 90, 52, 92, 40, 84

### **1.3**

Reverse the list using a loop and without any methods or built-in functions

    numbers: 5, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    [25, 8100, 1849, 2704, 441, 2401, 8464, 1600, 1089, 7056]

### **1.4**

Sort the list of numbers in ascending order without using methods or built-in functions.
