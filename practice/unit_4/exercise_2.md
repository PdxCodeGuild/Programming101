# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 2 - Sum, Mean, Mode**

Use a loop to create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100.

### **2.1**

Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the `sum`.

    numbers: 1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9
    sum: 39

### **2.2**

Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the `mean` (average).

    numbers: 1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9

    output:
    mean: 4.875

### **2.3**

Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the `mode`.

    numbers: 1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9

    output:
    mode: 4
