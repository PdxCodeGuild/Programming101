# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 3 - Flip the Numbers**

Use a loop to create a list of 10 random numbers between -100 and 100.

### **3.1**

Loop through the list of numbers and switch each number to its opposite sign. Negatives become positives, positives become negatives.

    numbers: [10, -36, 6, -39, -96, 13, -35, 83, -52, 86]
    flipped: [-10, 36, -6, 39, 96, -13, 35, -83, 52, -86]
