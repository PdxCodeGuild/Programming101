# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 1**

Create a list of 10 `numbers` between 1 and 10.

### **1.1**

Print all the number in the list that are less than 5.

    numbers: 3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2

    output: 
    Less than five: 3, 3, 4 2

### **1.2**
      
Count the number of times the number 5 occurs in your list.

    numbers: 3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2

    output:
    The number 5 occurs 3 times.

### **1.3**
Change the value of each number in the list to be the square of itself. Then print the new list.

      numbers: [3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2]

      output:
      [9, 9, 100, 25, 16, 25, 36, 25, 49, 4]
