# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 1**

Create a list of 10 `numbers` between 1 and 10.

### **1.1**

Print all the number in the list that are less than 5.

    numbers: 3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2

    output:
    Less than five: 3, 3, 4, 2

### **1.2**

Count the number of times the number 5 occurs in your list.

    numbers: 3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2

    output:
    The number 5 occurs 3 times.

### **1.3**

Change the value of each number in the list to be the square of itself. Then print the new list.

      numbers: [3, 3, 10, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2]

      output:
      [9, 9, 100, 25, 16, 25, 36, 25, 49, 4]

### **1.4**

Use a loop and `random.randint()` to generate a list of `random_numbers` between 1 and 100.

**1.4a**

Print all the number in the list that are less than 50.

    numbers: 85, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    output:
    less than 50: 43, 21, 49, 40, 33

**1.4b**

Count the number of even numbers in the list. **Hint**: You can use `% 2` to determine if a number is even or odd.

numbers: 5, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    output:
    There are 5 even numbers: 90, 52, 92, 40, 84

**1.4c**

Change the value of each number in the list to be the square of itself. Then print the new list.

    numbers: 5, 90, 43, 52, 21, 49, 92, 40, 33, 84

    output:
    [25, 8100, 1849, 2704, 441, 2401, 8464, 1600, 1089, 7056]
