# Unit 4 Practice Solutions

## **Exercise 5 - More Number Lists**

Use a loop and `random.randint()` to generate a list of ten `random_numbers` between 1 and 100.

### **5.1**

Count the even numbers

**Solution**

```python
import random

# generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
numbers = []
for i in range(10):
    numbers.append(random.randint(1,100))

# count the even numbers in the list
# create empty list for evens
evens = []

# loop through the numbers
for number in numbers:
    # check if the number is even
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # add it to the evens list
        evens.append(number)

# calculate the number of evens
evens_count = len(evens)

# display result
result = f'''Numbers: {numbers}
There are {evens_count} evens: {evens}'''

print(result)
```

**Output**

    Numbers: [64, 3, 55, 94, 40, 56, 40, 69, 54, 3]

    There are 6 evens: [64, 94, 40, 56, 40, 54]

### **5.2**

Reverse the list using a loop and without any methods or built-in functions

**Solution**

```python
import random

# generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
numbers = []
for i in range(10):
    numbers.append(random.randint(1,100))

# calculate the length of the numbers list
numbers_length = len(numbers)

# blank list for reverse
numbers_reversed = []
# loop backwards over one less than the length
for index in range(numbers_length - 1, -1, -1):
    # get the current number
    number = numbers[index]

    # add it to the reversed list
    numbers_reversed.append(number)

# display result
result = f'''numbers: {numbers}
reversed: {numbers_reversed}'''

print(result)
```

**Output**

    numbers: [62, 23, 56, 30, 55, 60, 31, 91, 93, 45]
    reversed: [45, 93, 91, 31, 60, 55, 30, 56, 23, 62]

### **5.3**

Sort the list of numbers in ascending order without using methods or built-in functions.

**Solution**

```python
numbers = [62, 23, 56, 30, 55, 60, 31, 91, 93, 45]

# print before sorting
print(f'numbers: {numbers}')


# loop: i = 0 -> (length of list - 1)
for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
    # set 'swap' variable to False
    swap = False

    # loop: j = 0 -> (length of list - 1)
    for j in range(len(numbers) - 1):

        #if list[j] is less than list[j+1]
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:
                #place list[j] in a 'bubble' variable
                bubble = numbers[j]
                # put list[j+1] at list[j]
                numbers[j] = numbers[j+1]
                # put bubble at list[j+1]
                numbers[j+1] = bubble

                # since a swap occured this loop,
                # set swap to True
                swap = True

        # if no swap occured, break the outer loop
        if not swap:
        break

# print after sorting
print(f'sorted:  {numbers}')
```

**Output**

    numbers: [62, 23, 56, 30, 55, 60, 31, 91, 93, 45]
    sorted:  [23, 30, 31, 45, 55, 56, 60, 62, 91, 93]

Keep in mind that is is just one potential solution
