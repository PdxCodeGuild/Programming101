# Unit 4 Practice Solutions

## Exercise 3 - Flip the Numbers

### **3.1**

**Solution**

```python
import random

#Use a loop to create a list of 10 random numbers between -100 and 100.

# create empty list
numbers = []
# loop 10 times
for i in range(10):
    # generate a random number between -100 and 100
    random_number = random.randint(-100,100)
    # add the random number to the list
    numbers.append(random_number)

#Loop through the list of numbers and switch each number to its opposite sign.

# create empty list
flipped = []
# loop through each number
for number in numbers:
    # flip the sign of the number
    flipped_number = number * -1
    # add to the new list
    flipped.append(flipped_number)

# display results
print(f'numbers: {numbers}')
print(f'flipped {flipped}')
```

Keep in mind that is is just one potential solution
