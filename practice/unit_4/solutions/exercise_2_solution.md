# Unit 4 Practice Solutions

## Exercise 2 - Sum, Mean, Mode

### **2.1**

Find the sum of the list of numbers

**Solution**

```python
import random

# Use a loop to create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 10.

# create empty list
numbers = []
# loop ten times
for i in range(10):
    # generate random number between 1 and 10
    random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    # add the number to the list
    numbers.append(random_number)

# Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the sum
# set the total to zero
total = 0
# loop through the numbers
for number in numbers:
    # add the number to the total
    total += number

# display the result
print(f'numbers: {numbers}')
print(f'sum: {total}')
```

**Output**

    numbers: [1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9]
    sum: 39

### **2.2**

Find the mean (average) of the list of numbers

**Solution**

```python
import random

# Use a loop to create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 10.

# create empty list
numbers = []
# loop ten times
for i in range(10):
# generate random number between 1 and 10
random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
# add the number to the list
numbers.append(random_number)

# Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the sum
# set the total to zero
total = 0
# loop through the numbers
for number in numbers:
    # add the number to the total
    total += number

# calculate the average
average = total / len(numbers)

# display the result
print(f'numbers: {numbers}')
print(f'average: {average}')
```

**Output**

    numbers: [1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9]
    average: 4.875

### **2.3**

Find the mode

**Solution**

```python
import random

# Use a loop to create a list of 20 random numbers between 1 and 10.

# create empty list
numbers = []
# loop twenty times
for i in range(20):
    # generate random number between 1 and 10
    random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    # add the number to the list
    numbers.append(random_number)

# Loop through the list of numbers and calculate the mode

# set the first element as the default mode
mode = numbers[0]
# number of occurances of the mode
mode_count = numbers.count(mode)

# loop through the list of numbers
for number in numbers:
    # calculate the number of times the old mode appears
    old_count = numbers.count(mode)

    # calculate the number of times the current number appears
    new_count = numbers.count(number)

    # if the current number occurs more times than the previous mode
    if new_count > old_count:
        # set the mode to the current number
        mode = number
        # count the occurances of the new mode
        mode_count = new_count

# display the result
result = f'''
numbers: {numbers}
mode: {mode}
The number {mode} appears {mode_count} times.
'''

print(result)
```

Keep in mind that is is just one potential solution
