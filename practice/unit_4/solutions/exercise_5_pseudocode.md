## **Exercise 5 - More Number Lists**

### Pseudocode

    loop: i = 0 -> (length of list - 1)
        set 'swap' variable to False

        loop: j = 0 -> (length of list - 1)
            if list[j] is greater than list[j+1]
                place list[j] in a 'bubble' variable

                put list[j] at list[j+1]

                put bubble at list[j+1]

                since a swap occured this loop,
                set swap to True

        if no swap occured, break the outer loop
