# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 4 - Looping Strings**

### **4.1**

Using a `for` loop, ask the user for the name of three items (animals, colors, fruits, or whatever you'd like).

### **4.2**

Loop through the user's list and with iteration, print both the item and all the letters in the item.

    numbers: [10, -36, 6, -39, -96, 13, -35, 83, -52, 86]
    flipped: [-10, 36, -6, 39, 96, -13, 35, -83, 52, -86]

### **4.3**

Loop through the list.

Loop through the letters of each word.

Create a list of the characters that occur in the list. Each letter may only occur in the list once.
