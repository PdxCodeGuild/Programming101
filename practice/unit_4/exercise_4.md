# **Unit 4 Practice**

## **Exercise 4 - Looping Strings**

### **4.1**

Using a `for` loop, ask the user for the name of three items (animals, colors, fruits, or whatever you'd like).

### **4.2**

Loop through the user's list and with iteration, print both the item and all the letters in the item.

    Enter an animal: lynx
    Enter an animal: ocelot
    Enter an animal: puma

    lynx
    l
    y
    n
    x
    ocelot
    o
    c
    e
    l
    o
    t
    puma
    p
    u
    m
    a

### **4.3**

Loop through the list.

Loop through the letters of each word.

Create a list of the characters that occur in the words. If a letter has already been added to the list, skip it.

**Output**

    Enter an animal: lynx
    Enter an animal: ocelot
    Enter an animal: puma

    Letters used:
    ['l', 'y', 'n', 'x', 'o', 'c', 'e', 't', 'p', 'u', 'm', 'a']
